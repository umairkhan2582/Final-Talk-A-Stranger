    title: "The Islamic Approach to Finding a Life Partner",
    content: [
      "In Islam, marriage is considered half of one's faith, making the search for a righteous spouse a deeply important journey. The process of finding a life partner should begin with sincere intention, seeking Allah's guidance through prayer and du'a. Unlike casual dating, Islamic courtship emphasizes getting to know someone's character, religious commitment, and compatibility for marriage.",
      "When searching for a spouse, focus on finding someone who shares your values and commitment to Islam. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) advised choosing a spouse based on their deen (religion and piety) above all else. While physical attraction, lineage, and wealth are natural considerations, they should not overshadow the importance of finding someone with good character and strong faith.",
      "Family involvement plays a crucial role in traditional Islamic matchmaking. Parents and relatives can help identify suitable candidates and provide wisdom from their life experience. However, both the man and woman must consent to the marriage - forced marriages are prohibited in Islam. Modern platforms like premium matchmaking services can complement traditional methods while maintaining Islamic values.",
      "The process should include chaperoned meetings where both parties can discuss important topics like religious practice, life goals, family expectations, and compatibility. These conversations should be purposeful and focused on determining marriage suitability, not casual entertainment. Prayer for guidance (Istikhara) is essential when making this life-changing decision."

    title: "Essential Qualities to Look for in a Groom",
    content: [
      "When evaluating a potential groom, his commitment to Islamic principles should be your primary concern. Observe how he practices his faith - does he pray regularly, fulfill his religious obligations, and demonstrate good Islamic character in his daily life? A man's relationship with Allah is the foundation of how he will treat his future wife and family.",
      "Financial responsibility is an important Islamic requirement for marriage. While a man doesn't need to be wealthy, he should have a halal source of income and the ability to provide for his family. Inquire about his career stability, financial planning, and attitude toward money. A responsible groom will be transparent about his financial situation and future plans.",
      "Character and manners (akhlaq) are essential indicators of a good spouse. Look for qualities like honesty, kindness, patience, generosity, and respect for women. Observe how he treats his mother, sisters, and other women in his life - this often reflects how he will treat his wife. His reputation in the community and among those who know him well can provide valuable insights.",
      "Compatibility in values and life goals is crucial for a successful marriage. Discuss expectations about family life, children, religious practice, career ambitions, and where you'll live. A good groom will be willing to have honest conversations about these important topics and work together to find common ground."

    title: "What to Look for When Choosing a Bride",
    content: [
      "The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said that a woman may be married for four reasons: her wealth, her lineage, her beauty, or her religious commitment - and advised to choose the one with religious commitment. A bride's dedication to Islam, her understanding of Islamic principles, and her practice of the faith should be paramount in your decision.",
      "Look for a woman with good character (akhlaq) and moral conduct. She should demonstrate qualities like modesty, kindness, patience, honesty, and respect. Her behavior toward her parents, especially her treatment of her mother, often indicates how she will approach family life. A woman who maintains strong family ties understands the importance of these relationships in marriage.",
      "Education and intellect matter in a life partner. A bride who values knowledge, whether religious or worldly, will be better equipped to raise righteous children and manage household affairs. Her ability to engage in meaningful conversation, make sound decisions, and contribute to family life through her wisdom is valuable for a strong marriage partnership.",
      "Compatibility in lifestyle and expectations is essential. Discuss her vision for married life, including her views on career and homemaking, raising children, religious practice, and family involvement. A suitable bride will be open to these discussions and willing to work together to build a harmonious Islamic household."

    title: "Building a Strong Foundation Before Marriage",
    content: [
      "Before entering marriage, both partners should work on personal development and spiritual growth. Strengthen your own relationship with Allah through regular prayer, Quran recitation, and seeking Islamic knowledge. A strong individual faith creates a stronger marriage foundation. Address personal shortcomings, heal from past experiences, and develop emotional maturity.",
      "Prepare yourself financially and practically for marriage responsibilities. For men, this means establishing a stable income and learning about the financial rights of a wife in Islam. For women, it includes understanding household management and the rights and duties of a wife. Both should learn about Islamic marital rights, responsibilities, and the etiquettes of married life.",
      "Seek pre-marital Islamic education and counseling. Many mosques and Islamic centers offer courses covering important topics like intimacy in Islam, conflict resolution, communication skills, and managing extended family relationships. Don't assume you'll figure everything out after marriage - proactive learning prevents many common problems.",
      "Make du'a (supplication) consistently, asking Allah to grant you a righteous spouse and a blessed marriage. Trust in Allah's timing and wisdom. Sometimes what seems like a delay is actually Allah's protection, saving you from someone unsuitable. Maintain patience and continue improving yourself while waiting for the right person."

    title: "Red Flags to Watch for When Choosing a Spouse",
    content: [
      "Be cautious of anyone who is secretive about their past or unwilling to have honest conversations about important topics. While everyone deserves privacy, excessive evasiveness about family background, past relationships, or current circumstances can indicate problems. A potential spouse should be reasonably transparent when discussing matters relevant to marriage.",
      "Watch for signs of poor character or concerning behavior. Red flags include displays of anger, disrespect toward parents or elders, dishonesty in small matters, arrogance, or reluctance to discuss Islamic values. How someone behaves before marriage often intensifies after marriage, so don't ignore warning signs hoping they'll change.",
      "Be wary of anyone who pressures you to rush into marriage without proper time for consideration and family involvement. A sincere person will respect the Islamic process of getting to know each other appropriately and won't try to bypass important steps like meeting families or allowing time for Istikhara.",
      "Notice if someone's lifestyle contradicts Islamic principles. While no one is perfect, persistent neglect of religious obligations, involvement in haram activities, or resistance to Islamic guidance are serious concerns. Marrying someone hoping to change them after marriage often leads to disappointment and hardship."

    title: "The Role of Family in Islamic Matchmaking",
    content: [
      "In Islamic tradition, families play a supportive and protective role in the marriage process. Parents bring wisdom, life experience, and often can see qualities or concerns that emotion might cloud. Their involvement helps ensure both parties are suitable for each other and helps families build bonds that strengthen the marriage foundation.",
      "Family members can serve as valuable sources of information about a potential spouse. They can help investigate the person's background, reputation in the community, and family circumstances. This protective measure helps prevent deception and ensures both parties enter marriage with clear understanding and transparency.",
      "While family input is valuable, the final decision must be made by the individuals getting married. Islam grants both men and women the right to accept or reject a proposal. Parents should guide, not force. Similarly, children should respectfully consider their parents' wisdom while ultimately making their own informed decision.",
      "Modern matchmaking approaches can complement traditional family involvement. Premium matchmaking services, community introductions, and mosque-based programs provide additional avenues for meeting potential spouses while maintaining Islamic values and family involvement. The method may vary, but the principles of family support and Islamic guidance remain constant."

    title: "How to Talk to Girls and Boys Online for Marriage",
    content: [
      "When using video chat platforms to talk to girls or boys for marriage purposes, always start with respect and clear intentions. Introduce yourself politely and immediately express that you're seeking serious connections for marriage, not casual chat. This sets proper boundaries and ensures both parties understand the conversation's purpose.",
      "Talk to girls with genuine interest in their personality, values, and life goals. Ask about their religious practice, family background, education, and what they seek in marriage. Listen actively and show respect for their opinions. Avoid inappropriate topics or compliments about physical appearance during initial conversations.",
      "When talking to boys, assess their character, financial stability, and commitment to Islamic values. Ask about their career, family relationships, and vision for married life. Boys serious about marriage will welcome these questions and provide honest, thoughtful answers. Avoid superficial chat - focus on compatibility factors.",
      "Use video chat to observe body language, communication style, and genuine reactions. This helps you get to know someone better than text messaging. However, maintain modest dress and appropriate setting even on video calls. After meaningful conversations, involve families for the next steps toward marriage."

    title: "How to Get Married Using Online Chat and Video Platforms",
    content: [
      "Online chat and video platforms offer modern ways to meet potential marriage partners worldwide. Start by creating an honest profile expressing your serious marriage intentions. Use reputable platforms that cater to marriage-minded users, not casual dating sites. Be clear about seeking marriage to attract like-minded individuals.",
      "When you chat with strangers online, screen them carefully for marriage suitability. Ask about their background, values, and why they're seeking marriage. Video chat helps verify identity and build trust faster than text alone. Look for consistent behavior and truthfulness across multiple conversations.",
      "Use talk sessions to discuss essential marriage topics: religious compatibility, financial expectations, family involvement, living arrangements, and children. Quality conversations matter more than quantity. Focus on meaningful exchanges that reveal character and compatibility rather than endless small talk.",
      "Once you find a compatible match through online chat, transition to family involvement quickly. Share contact information with parents or guardians, arrange in-person meetings with family present, and follow traditional courtship steps. Online platforms are for initial connections - the marriage process requires real-world family engagement."

    title: "Best Age and Ethnicity Considerations for Marriage",
    content: [
      "Islam provides guidance on suitable marriage ages. Girls typically reach marriage readiness in late teens to early twenties, while boys often marry in their twenties when more financially established. However, the Prophet (peace be upon him) married at various ages, showing flexibility. The key is physical, emotional, and financial readiness rather than a specific age.",
      "Age compatibility matters for long-term harmony. Generally, partners close in age (within 5-10 years) share similar life stages and cultural references. However, larger age gaps can work when both parties are mature and compatible. Discuss expectations openly - an older partner may have different energy levels or life priorities.",
      "Regarding ethnicity, Islam teaches that all believers are equal regardless of background. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said piety is the primary criterion, not lineage or ethnicity. However, cultural compatibility can ease marriage adjustment. Shared language, customs, and family expectations often make married life smoother.",
      "If considering cross-cultural or cross-ethnic marriage, discuss potential challenges: language barriers, family acceptance, cultural practices, and where to live. Talk to couples from similar backgrounds for advice. Strong compatibility in faith, values, and communication can overcome ethnic differences, but awareness and preparation help ensure success."

    content: [
      "Begin wedding planning with the Islamic marriage contract (nikah). This can be simple or elaborate but must include: bride's consent, groom's consent, witnesses, and mahr (dowry) agreement. Many couples hold the nikah at the mosque with an imam officiating, family witnesses present, and a brief Islamic sermon about marriage.",
      "Plan the walima (wedding feast) as a Sunnah celebration to announce the marriage. Keep it modest and within budget - Islam discourages extravagance. Choose a halal venue, serve halal food, ensure gender-appropriate seating if needed, and avoid music or entertainment that contradicts Islamic values. Focus on joy, gratitude, and bringing communities together.",
      "For the wedding day, maintain Islamic guidelines: modest dress for bride and groom, segregation of genders if preferred by your community, Islamic recitations rather than music, and avoiding wasteful spending. Many couples include Quran recitation, Islamic nasheeds, and du'as for the new marriage during the ceremony.",
      "After the wedding, focus on starting married life properly: move into your home together, establish prayer routines as a couple, discuss roles and responsibilities, and build strong communication patterns. The wedding is one day - invest more energy in preparing for a lifetime marriage than in an elaborate ceremony."

    content: [
      "Begin by making sincere du'a to Allah, asking for guidance in finding a righteous spouse. Set aside time daily to pray Istikhara, seeking Allah's help in this important decision. Clarify your intentions - you're seeking marriage for the sake of Allah, to complete half your deen, not just for worldly desires.",
      "Create a clear vision of what you're looking for in a spouse. Write down essential qualities based on Islamic priorities: religious commitment, good character, compatibility in values and life goals. Be realistic about your expectations while knowing your non-negotiable requirements.",
      "Inform trusted family members and friends of your search. In Islamic cultures, many successful marriages begin through family networks and community connections. Let righteous people in your life know you're ready for marriage - they may know suitable candidates.",
      "Explore halal avenues for meeting potential spouses: mosque community events, Islamic conferences, family introductions, and reputable Islamic matchmaking services. Avoid dating culture and casual relationships. Always maintain Islamic boundaries and involve family appropriately in the process."

      "The first meeting should take place in the presence of a mahram (male guardian) for women, or at minimum in a public setting with other people present. This maintains Islamic propriety and protects both parties' reputations. Choose a comfortable, modest environment conducive to serious conversation.",
      "Prepare thoughtful questions beforehand covering important topics: religious practice and knowledge, family background and relationships, education and career, financial situation and expectations, views on children and parenting, lifestyle preferences, and life goals. Don't be shy about asking important questions - this is a marriage interview, not a social chat.",
      "Observe their behavior, manners, and how they interact with others. Notice how they speak about their family, their attitude toward Islamic obligations, their general demeanor. Body language, tone, and character often reveal more than words alone.",
      "After the meeting, take time for reflection and Istikhara before making any decisions. Discuss your impressions with family members whose judgment you trust. Don't rush - it's better to take time to ensure compatibility than to hurry into a marriage that may not be suitable."

    title: "How to Perform Salat al-Istikhara for Marriage Decisions",
    content: [
      "Istikhara is a powerful tool Allah has given us to seek His guidance when making important decisions. For marriage, perform Istikhara after you've met someone and are considering proceeding further. First, pray two rakats of optional prayer (nafl) at any time except the disliked times for prayer.",
      "After completing the two rakats, recite the Istikhara du'a. The complete du'a can be found in authentic hadith collections. You may recite it in Arabic if you know it, or in your own language. Speak to Allah sincerely, asking Him to facilitate what is good for you in this life and the hereafter, and to turn away what is harmful.",
      "After making Istikhara, proceed with practical steps while remaining open to how things unfold. Istikhara doesn't usually come as a dream or clear sign - rather, Allah guides you through events, circumstances, and feelings of ease or difficulty as you move forward. Trust that Allah will guide you to what's best.",
      "Repeat Istikhara whenever you face a new significant decision in the process - before agreeing to meet, before accepting a proposal, before setting a wedding date. Continuously seeking Allah's guidance keeps your heart connected to Him throughout this important journey."

      "Start by assessing religious compatibility - the most important factor in Islamic marriage. Compare your levels of religious practice, knowledge, and commitment. Do you share similar views on fundamental Islamic obligations? Are you both striving to grow closer to Allah? Different levels of religiosity often create significant friction in marriage.",
      "Discuss life goals and priorities openly. Where do each of you see yourselves in five, ten, twenty years? What are your career ambitions? How do you view work-life balance? Do you want children, and if so, how many? How will you approach parenting? What role will extended family play in your lives? Misaligned goals cause many marital conflicts.",
      "Evaluate personality and communication compatibility. You don't need identical personalities, but you should be able to communicate effectively, resolve disagreements respectfully, and appreciate each other's temperaments. Consider whether you're both introverts or extroverts, how you handle stress, and your general approach to life's challenges.",
      "Assess practical compatibility in daily life: living arrangements, financial management, household responsibilities, social life, and cultural practices. While compromise is part of marriage, some differences are harder to bridge than others. Be honest about what you can and cannot adapt to for a lifetime."

// FAQs about Islamic marriage and matchmaking
export const marriageFaqs: Array<{question: string; answer: string}> = [
  {
    question: "What is the Islamic ruling on using matchmaking services to find a spouse?",
    answer: "Using matchmaking services is permissible in Islam as long as the process maintains Islamic boundaries and values. The service should facilitate introductions while respecting mahram requirements, encouraging family involvement, and supporting the Islamic courtship process. Premium matchmaking services can be especially valuable as they often pre-screen candidates for religious compatibility and serious marriage intentions, though always verify the credibility and Islamic compliance of any service before using it."
  },
  {
    question: "How long should the courtship period be before marriage?",
    answer: "There is no fixed time period in Islam, but the courtship should be long enough to make an informed decision while not so long that it leads to inappropriate attachment or situations. Typically, a few months is sufficient to meet several times in appropriate settings, discuss important topics, consult families, and perform Istikhara. The focus should be on quality of interaction and information gathered rather than duration. Avoid unnecessarily prolonged engagements that test your ability to maintain Islamic boundaries."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I reject someone my parents choose for me?",
    answer: "Yes, absolutely. Both men and women in Islam have the right to accept or reject a marriage proposal. Forced marriages are prohibited - marriage requires the free consent of both parties. While you should respectfully consider your parents' choice and their wisdom, the final decision is yours. The Prophet (peace be upon him) specifically emphasized that a previously married woman must give her explicit consent, and a virgin's consent should be sought and her silence may indicate consent, but she must not be forced."
  },
  {
    question: "What questions should I ask a potential spouse?",
    answer: "Essential questions cover religious practice and goals, family relationships and expectations, financial situation and management style, views on children and parenting, career ambitions and work-life balance, expectations about household roles, living arrangements, and how they envision married life. Also discuss past significant relationships, health issues, debts, and anything that would significantly impact married life. Don't shy away from important but uncomfortable topics - it's better to have difficult conversations now than face problems after marriage."
  },
  {
    question: "Is it allowed to see the person before marriage?",
    answer: "Yes, Islam permits and even encourages seeing a potential spouse before marriage. The Prophet (peace be upon him) encouraged looking at the person you intend to marry, as this helps create attraction and compatibility. However, this should be done in an appropriate manner - in the presence of family or in a public setting, with modest dress, and with serious marriage intentions. Casual dating and inappropriate physical contact are not permitted."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I know if someone is truly committed to Islam?",
    answer: "Look beyond surface-level claims to observable actions. Do they pray five times daily? How is their relationship with the Quran? Do they fulfill obligatory fasts and give charity? How do they speak about Allah and Islamic principles? Observe their character, honesty, and treatment of others. Ask about their Islamic knowledge and goals for spiritual growth. Speak with people who know them well about their reputation. Someone truly committed to Islam will demonstrate it consistently in their daily life, not just during courtship."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the role of a mahram during the marriage search?",
    answer: "A mahram (male guardian for women) serves as a protector and observer during the courtship process. They help ensure interactions remain appropriate and within Islamic boundaries. A mahram can attend meetings, ask questions, and help evaluate the suitability of a potential spouse. Their presence protects both parties' reputations and provides a witness to what was discussed. They should facilitate meaningful conversation while maintaining propriety, not obstruct the process. For men, having a trusted family member present for meetings is also advisable though not strictly required."
  },
  {
    question: "Should I use premium matchmaking services or rely on traditional family networks?",
    answer: "Both approaches can be beneficial and they're not mutually exclusive. Traditional family networks offer trust, personal knowledge of candidates, and built-in family support. Premium matchmaking services provide access to a larger pool of serious marriage-seekers, professional screening, and privacy for those without extensive family networks. Consider using both approaches: let family know you're searching while also exploring reputable Islamic matchmaking services. The key is maintaining Islamic values regardless of the method. Premium services work best when they complement rather than replace family involvement."
